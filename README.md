# Today I learned 

This is a fact-sharing app where users can find and share anything that they think everyone should know. Please check out the [deployed project](https://today-i-learned-jk27.netlify.app/). 

# Features 
- Using the menu on the left, you can filter the facts by category. 
- Clicking on the source link will redirect you to a website where you can find more information about that fact. 
- You can react to each fact using the three buttons on the bottom-left corner of fact, depending of if you liked the fact, it has blown your mind or you think that it is not correct. 
- If a fact has more dispute votes than likes, a "DISPUTED" badge will appear at the begining of the fact. 
- You can also share a fact by clicking on the button at the top-right corner. This will display a form where you need to type your fact, provide a valid link with the source of the fact and also select a category for it. All fields are mandatory. **PLEASE NOTE** In order to keep the database clean and tidy, this functionality is currently disabled.
